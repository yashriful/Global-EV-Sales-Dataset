🌍🔋 Global EV Sales Analysis Dashboard 🚗⚡
🌟 Project Overview
This project analyzes Global Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Trends from 2010 to 2035, focusing on:

🌍 Regional performance across key markets
🚙 Vehicle types and category comparisons
🔮 Future sales forecasts and evolving industry trends
The Tableau Dashboard offers interactive visual insights into the evolving EV market, including total global sales, regional comparisons, and future predictions.

📊 Data Source
💾 Kaggle - Global Electric Vehicle Market Dataset
The dataset has been processed, cleaned, and visualized using Excel and Tableau Public.

📊 Key Findings — Why EV Sales are Declining
Despite the initial rapid growth in EV sales, both data trends and market research suggest a slowing global adoption rate. Several critical factors are contributing to this:

🔋 Long Charging Times
EVs take much longer to charge compared to traditional petrol/diesel vehicles, making EVs less convenient for long-distance or spontaneous travel.

💸 Battery Replacement Costs
EV batteries are expensive to replace, with costs ranging from $10,000 to $20,000, making long-term ownership significantly more expensive.

♻️ Battery Recycling Challenges
Recycling lithium-ion batteries is technically complex and prohibitively expensive, raising serious environmental and economic concerns.

🌍 Electricity Generation Issues
A significant portion of electricity used to charge EVs still comes from coal and diesel-powered plants, contributing to higher global warming emissions rather than reducing them.

🚗 Shifting Industry Focus
Major automakers like BMW and Mercedes-Benz are phasing out mass EV production, instead pivoting towards hydrogen fuel cell technology, which could offer a cleaner and more sustainable alternative.

🌱 Hydrogen: The Future?
🚗 BMW and Mercedes-Benz have already started to reduce investments in mass EV production, reallocating resources towards hydrogen fuel cell technology.

Why Hydrogen?
⚡️ Faster refueling times (similar to gasoline vehicles).
🔋 Reduced reliance on rare earth metals, avoiding many battery supply chain challenges.
🌿 Lower carbon footprint, especially when hydrogen is produced sustainably using renewable energy (green hydrogen).
