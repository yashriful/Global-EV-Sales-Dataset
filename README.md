🌍🔋 Global EV Sales Analysis Dashboard 🚗⚡


🌟 Project Overview
This project analyzes Global Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Trends from 2010 to 2035, focusing on regional performance, vehicle types, and future forecasts. The Tableau Dashboard provides interactive visual insights into the evolving EV market, including total sales, regional comparisons, and forecasted trends.

📊 Data Source: Kaggle - Global Electric Vehicle Market Dataset
💾 The data has been processed, cleaned, and visualized using Excel and Tableau Public.

📊 Key Findings — Why EV Sales are Declining
Despite the initial rapid growth in EV sales, the data and market research suggest that global EV adoption rates are now slowing down due to several critical factors:

🔋 Long Charging Times - EVs still take much longer to charge compared to refueling petrol/diesel cars.
💸 Battery Replacement Costs - EV batteries are expensive to replace, making long-term ownership costly.
♻️ Battery Recycling Challenges - Recycling lithium-ion batteries is technically complex and very costly, adding to environmental concerns.
🌍 Electricity Generation Issues - A significant amount of electricity for EV charging comes from coal and diesel-powered plants, increasing global warming emissions rather than reducing them.
🚗 Shifting Industry Focus - Major automakers like BMW and Mercedes-Benz are phasing out mass EV production and focusing on hydrogen fuel cell technology, which could be a cleaner and more sustainable alternative.
